SENTIMENT ANALYSIS on vlsp dataset

This is my assignment for "Modern Approach in Natural Language Processing" course.

vlsp is a Vietnamese electronics review dataset. In this assignment, I have built some models using CNN, LSTM and some combining both. 

This git includes the dataset, my source code, report and some additional files.

Vietnamese-CBOW that I used can be download here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g01ZkLu32oAMVRfGsjwybSgSE6Sa17LF/view?usp=sharing

This is my first time doing NLP task, so these source code and report is for reference only.
